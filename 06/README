This directory implements the assembler specified in Unit 6 of Nand2Tetris.
Given one or more .asm files, a corresponding .hack file will be produced.
This assembler assumes the .asm file is bug free, meeting all language specifications.

To operate:
- Use Ruby to run assembler.rb, specifying any number of file names
- For example, to assemble the file Rect.asm in the rect directory, run:
      "ruby assembler.rb rect/Rect.asm"
- Rect.hack will be generated in the rect directory.
- To convert multiple files at once, specify them in sequence.
- For example, to assemble Rect.asm and Add.asm in their respective directories:
      "ruby assembler.rb rect/Rect.asm add/Add.asm"
